### Envato Tuts+ Tutorial: Foundation for Emails: How to Use Panini Partials
#### Instructor: [Luke Spoor](https://tutsplus.com/authors/luke-spoor)

In this tutorial, we’ll be using ZURB’s Foundation for Emails to create a simple functioning email. We’ll explore various libraries provided by the framework, specifically “Panini”. Panini allows us to do a few things but we’ll be focusing on its partials feature.

We’ll be using a design put together with Web Wireframe Kit available from Envato Elements.
